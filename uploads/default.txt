ANTS OF THE UNIVERSE
â€œThe earth's crust was formed about 4 billion years ago, and all that scienceknows is that something like man existed 1 million years ago! And out of thatgigantic river of time it has managed to dam up only a tiny rivulet of 7,000years of human history..."We--the paragons of creation?--took 400,000 years to reach our present stateand our present stature. Who can produce concrete proof to show why anotherplanet should not have provided more favorable conditions for the development ofother or similar intelligences?"The time has come for us to admit our insignificance by making discoveries inthe infinite unexplored cosmos. Only then shall we realize that we are nothingbut ants in the vast state of the universe."-Erich Von DanikenThis low priced Bantam Bookhas been completely reset in a type facedesigned for easy reading, and was printedfrom new plates.
